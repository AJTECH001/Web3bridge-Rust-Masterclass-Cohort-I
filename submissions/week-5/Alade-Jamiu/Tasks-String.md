**Summary:**  
This project reimplements OpenZeppelin's `Strings.sol` library in Rust for the Stylus SDK, providing utility functions to convert `U256` values into decimal and hexadecimal strings. It includes `to_string` for decimal conversion, `to_hex_string` for variable-length hex strings, and `to_hex_string_fixed` for fixed-length hex strings with a `0x` prefix. The library is thoroughly tested with unit tests covering typical and edge cases, and a demo Stylus contract demonstrates its usage in a smart contract environment.
